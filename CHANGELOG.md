# Changelog

All notable changes to MLX-Flash are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.1] - 2026-10-06

### Changes
- test: gate native cache and API contracts on real MLX proofs (#23)
- fix: use configured Python for Metal revision artifacts (#24)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-06

### Changes
- Automatically prepare matching package versions and tracked release notes in a reviewable release PR after successful main CI; dispatch bot-PR checks explicitly and publish only after merge.
- Use native generation accounting, sampling, and stop metadata (#19)
- docs: document Qwen3.8 lab and Metal CI upgrade (#20)
- feat: reuse bounded native prompt state and support Gemma/LFM checks (#21)

Native prefix-cache measurements describe reused prefill work, not provider-billed monetary savings. Local SSE remains buffered; see [native cache details](docs/native-prompt-cache.md).

## Historical unversioned notes

The notes below were retained from the old `Unreleased — v0.6.0` heading.
They do not identify a new release or establish current benchmark guarantees.

### Added
- **Gemma 4 as default model** — chat auto-detects best Gemma 4 model (E2B/E4B/26B MoE/31B) for your hardware
- **Page cache control** — `madvise(MADV_FREE)` via ctypes for macOS page cache eviction of expert weights
- **Pipelined execution** — phase-level IO/compute overlap (prefetch attention during norm, prefetch MLP during attention)
- **Metal kernel acceleration** — custom `.metal` shaders: fused Q4 dequant+GEMV, SwiGLU fusion, MoE expert dispatch
- **Bit-parity verification** — FP32 accumulation proves streaming output matches standard MLX exactly (0.0 delta)
- **mlx-lm monkey patching** — `apply_flash_patch()` transparently enables Flash mode for LM Studio and any mlx-lm user
- **Gemma 4 benchmark suite** — `python -m mlx_flash_compress.bench_gemma4` tests all Gemma 4 sizes on your hardware
- **Comprehensive test suite** — 45 new tests for page_cache, pipeline, bit_parity, mlx_lm_patch, kernels, chat auto-select
- **Coverage reporting** — CI now reports test coverage with 90%+ target
- **Docker and Homebrew install** — instructions in main README Quick Start
- **GitHub Release badge** — auto-updated from latest release tag
- **Homebrew version badge** — auto-updated from version.json in tap repo

### Fixed
- **Homebrew release workflow** — GITHUB_TOKEN replaced with HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN PAT for cross-repo push
- **Homebrew auth chain** — explicit `git remote set-url` ensures token persists for push
- **Token validation** — workflow fails fast with clear error if HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN is not set

### Changed
- **README rewrite** — restructured for non-technical users: "Why?" comparison table, 3-step Quick Start, Supported Models
- **Technical deep-dives moved** to `docs/internals.md`: Core Modules, Research & Techniques, Competition, Key Discoveries
- **Performance docs updated** — new techniques documented with measured/estimated gains

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- Memory safety guards — prevent Mac crashes on large model loads
- Interactive command helper — tips, autocomplete hints, welcome guide

- Model size calculator — estimate memory for any MoE or dense model

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- Web search — DuckDuckGo search + persistent memory (Perplexity-style local)
- Model catalog — `/models` browser and `/model N` live switching
- Colorful chat UI — download progress, memory bars, emoji status

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- Colorful chat UI with download progress, memory bars, emoji status
- Smart model defaults — Qwen3-8B for chat, auto-select for serve
- Upgraded default model to Qwen3-30B-A3B-4bit

### Fixed

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- Initial release
- LCP smart cache with layer-depth biased eviction
- LZ4/ZSTD/LZFSE compression
